# Rebrain DevOps training repository
This is going to be just a training repo

## **Note**
This README is supposed to be updated as this repo will get more code.

## Getting started
Actually, you should not use this repo to do anything, haha

### Prerequisites
You will need to install 'nginx' to start use this configuration file.

### Installation
As you can guess, it's pretty easy:
```
On Ubuntu: sudo apt install nginx
On CentOS: sudo yum install ngins
```
### Configuration
After nginx installation you can try this nginx configuration file

## Apply changes:
* Test configuration:
  ``` sudo nginx -t ```
* Restart nginx (example for SystemD OS like Ubuntu 16.04+ or CentOS 7+:
  ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ```
* Go to you browser and test

### *Yet other text can be here*
*A lot of typing can be done......*
